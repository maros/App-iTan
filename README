DESCRIPTION
    This command line application facilitates the handling of iTANs (indexed
    Transaction Numbers) as used by various online banking tools.

COMMANDS
  import
    Imports a list of iTans into the database.

     itan.pl import --file IMPORT_FILE [--deletefile] [--overwrite]

    *   file

        Path to a file containing the iTans to be imported. The file must
        contain two columns (separated by any non numeric characters). The
        first column must be the index number. The second column must be the
        tan number. If your online banking appication does not use index
        numbers just set the first column to zero.

    *   deletefile

        Delete import file after a successful import

    *   overwrite

        overwritten.
