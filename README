NAME
    App::iTan - Secure management of iTans for online banking

SYNOPSIS
     # Import a list of itans
     console$ itan import --file itanlist.txt

DESCRIPTION
    This command line application facilitates the secure handling of iTANs
    (indexed Transaction Numbers) as used by various online banking tools.

    iTANs are encrypted using Crypt::Twofish and are by default stored in a
    SQLite database located at ~/.itan. (Patches for other database vendors
    welcome)

COMMANDS
  import
    Imports a list of iTans into the database.

     itan import --file IMPORT_FILE [--deletefile] [--overwrite]

    *   file

        Path to a file containing the iTans to be imported. The file must
        contain two columns (separated by any non numeric characters). The
        first column must be the index number. The second column must be the
        tan number. If your online banking appication does not use index
        numbers just set the first column to zero.

    *   deletefile

        Option to delete the import file after a successful import

        overwritten.
