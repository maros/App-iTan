# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

This command line application facilitates the secure handling of iTANs 
(indexed Transaction Numbers) as used by various online banking tools. 

iTANs are encrypted using [Crypt::Twofish](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Crypt::Twofish) and are by default stored 
in a SQLite database located at ~/.itan. (Patches for other database
vendors welcome)

# COMMANDS

## import

Imports a list of iTans into the database. 

 itan import --file IMPORT_FILE [--deletefile] [--overwrite]

- * file

Path to a file containing the iTans to be imported. The file must contain
two columns (separated by any non numeric characters). The first 
column must be the index number. The second column must be the tan 
number. If your online banking appication does not use index numbers just set
the first column to zero.
